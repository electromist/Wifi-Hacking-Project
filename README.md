### Project Overview

In today's interconnected world, ensuring the security of your wireless networks is of paramount importance. This project aims to empower users with the knowledge and tools necessary to identify and address vulnerabilities in their Wi-Fi networks. It emphasizes ethical and responsible network auditing and penetration testing.
Prerequisites

### Before getting started with this project, you will need the following:

    A compatible Wi-Fi adapter that supports Monitor Mode (e.g., TP-Link AC600).
    A virtual machine setup with Kali Linux for conducting ethical hacking and network auditing.
    A Windows 11 environment for processing captured data and conducting password decryption.

### Project Setup

    Kali Linux and Wi-Fi Adapter Setup: This project assumes you have Kali Linux installed on a virtual machine with your Wi-Fi adapter properly configured to support Monitor Mode.

    Installation of WiFite2: The guide demonstrates how to install WiFite2, a powerful Wi-Fi auditing tool that simplifies the process of capturing network handshakes.

    Handshake Capture: You'll learn how to use WiFite2 to capture Wi-Fi handshakes from target networks.

    Password Decryption: The project guides you through the process of transferring captured data to Windows, using Hashcat to decrypt passwords, and downloading wordlists.

    Ethical Use: The README emphasizes the ethical and responsible use of Wi-Fi hacking tools, reminding users to obtain proper permissions and adhere to legal standards.

### Usage

This project offers a practical, hands-on approach to network security auditing. By following the steps outlined in the guide, users can gain valuable insights into the security of their wireless networks, identify vulnerabilities, and take appropriate measures to secure their networks.

Disclaimer: It is essential to use these tools responsibly and only on networks for which you have explicit permission. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical.
